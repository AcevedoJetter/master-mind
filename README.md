# Master Mind Game and Solver

# main.py

Run the python file in the terminal: `python3 main.py`. After this, the game begins and you should take the first guess. To guess, write the first letter of the color you would like to guess. The six colors are the following: red (r), blue (b), yellow (y), green (g), orange (o), and purple (p). A guess consist of four colors, which could be repeated, separated by a space. Examples: `r b g y`, `r r b o`, `p p p p`. After this, you will get a message with the amount of black key pegs and white key pegs in no specific order. A black key peg means that you got a color in the correct position and a white key peg means that you have a correct color but in the wrong position. This will be given as four strings `b`, `w`, and `_` for black key peg, white key peg, and not a black key peg nor a white key peg, respectively. This will continue until you get the correct combination or you have used all your guesses.
